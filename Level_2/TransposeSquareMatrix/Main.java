/**
 * You are given a square 2D image matrix where each integer represents a pixel.
 * Write a method transposeMatrix to transform the matrix into its Transpose - in-place. 
 * (MY NOTE: since has to be "in place" assumption is that length = height, otherwise
 * you would need another matrix with shifted row/col length values...)
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 *  Input image :
 *  1 0
 *  1 0
 *  
 *  Modified to :
 *  1 1
 *  0 0
